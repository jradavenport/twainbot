twainbot
========

This is the code I used to create the Twitter-bot @Mock_Twain, which tweets 10x per day (via cron) on a RaspberryPi that lives inside hollowed out book. The bot is slowly tweeting the entirey of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. 

I was learning python as I went, so I hope this code can be used as a simple how-to example of using Tweepy/Twitter API, the Dropbox SDK, and some simple NLTK.
